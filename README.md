<!-- PROJECT DESCRIPTION -->


# 📖 Math magician <a name="about-project"></a>
### `npm run build`


> I developed a leaderboard using React, and APIs. This project aims to create a simple and intuitive interface that allows users to perform math task in a style manner.👌
Builds the app for production to the `build` folder.\
It correctly bundles React in production mode and optimizes the build for the best performance.




### Tech Stack <a name="tech-stack"></a>
### `npm run eject`


- HTML-5
**Note: this is a one-way operation. Once you `eject`, you can't go back!**
- CSS3
- Java Script ES 6
- Linters
- webpack
- React 
- babel


<details>
If you aren't satisfied with the build tool and configuration choices, you can `eject` at any time. This command will remove the single build dependency from your project.
  <summary>Client</summary>
  <ul>
    <li><a href="https://github.com/microverseinc/linters-config/tree/master/html-css-js">Linters</a></li>
    <li><a href="https://www.w3schools.com/html/">HTML</a></li>
    <li><a href="https://www.w3schools.com/css/">CSS</a></li>
  </ul> 
</details>


Instead, it will copy all the configuration files and the transitive dependencies (webpack, Babel, ESLint, etc) right into your project so you have full control over them. All of the commands except `eject` will still work, but they will point to the copied scripts so you can tweak them. At this point you're on your own.


<p align="right">(<a href="#readme-top">back to top</a>)</p>
You don't have to ever use `eject`. The curated feature set is suitable for small and middle deployments, and you shouldn't feel obligated to use this feature. However we understand that this tool wouldn't be useful if you couldn't customize it when you are ready for it.

This section has moved here: [https://facebook.github.io/create-react-app/docs/deployment](https://facebook.github.io/create-react-app/docs/deployment)


- git clone  [ https://github.com/techmoves/math-magicians.git]
### `npm run build` fails to minify


- Clone the repository to your local machine using the git clone command as described in the previous answer.
This section has moved here: [https://facebook.github.io/create-react-app/docs/troubleshooting#npm-run-build-fails-to-minify](https://facebook.github.io/create-react-app/docs/troubleshooting#npm-run-build-fails-to-minify)
Navigate to the project folder using a command-line interface such as Terminal or Command Prompt.
Install any necessary dependencies using a package manager such as NPM or Yarn. You can do this by running the npm install or yarn install command in the project folder.
Start the local server using a command such as npm start or yarn start, depending on the project's setup.
Open a web browser and navigate to the local server's URL to view and test the project.

### Usage

- Assuming that you have installed the project's dependencies and started the local server, you can run the project by following these steps:

Open a web browser such as Google Chrome, Mozilla Firefox, or Safari.
In the address bar, type the URL of the local server that you started in the previous step. This will typically be something like http://localhost:3000.
Press enter to navigate to the local server's URL.
The project should now be running in your web browser. Use the website's interface to interact with the project and test its functionality.

### Run tests
